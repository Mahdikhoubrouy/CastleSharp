CastleSharp Telegram Bot is a powerful and flexible C# library designed to simplify the development of Telegram bots. Using Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) principles, CastleSharp allows developers to handle bot commands through custom attributes and condition-based handling. This design promotes cleaner, more modular code and enhances reusability and maintainability for complex bot functionality.
